🚀 Web Development Learning Series

Hey there! 👋

I’ve started a daily web development learning series and I’m posting everything here.
I’m already 13 days in, but I’ll be uploading the first 14 days together (so you don’t miss the foundation) and then I’ll keep posting daily from Day 14 onward.

💡 What’s covered so far (Days 1–13):

How the internet really works 🌍 (TCP, UDP, HTTP, TLS…)

HTML essentials (structuring pages)

CSS basics (fonts, backgrounds, positions)

🔮 What’s next:
From Day 14, you’ll see daily hands-on learning logs with code, projects, and notes. Think of it as my developer journey in public, one commit at a time.

This repo isn’t just notes — it’s a living timeline of growth. If you’re a recruiter, peer, or fellow learner, you can literally scroll through my progress day by day.

Stay tuned, because this is just the beginning. ⚡
